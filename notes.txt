Create new phoenix project
    mix phx.new hello

    when creating phoenix project do we need webpack or not(--no-webpack)
      we do because live view uses app.js to start infrastructure

    without database --no-ecto

lost on how to put the first page/component
missing information to install live_view from git

VSCode Elixir_LS mix.lock
  warning: found quoted keyword "surface" but the quotes are not required. Note that keywords are always atoms, even when quoted. Similar to atoms, keywords made exclusively of Unicode letters, numbers, underscore, and @ do not require quotes

formatting

space on
      <button>
      {{ @inner_content.() }}
      </button>
  becomes
      <button>
      {{ @inner_content.() }}
      ////this empty line
      </button>

  formatting?
  paste should format
  class={{
    "button", # paints the string
    "is-#{@color}": @color !== nil, # doesn't paint the string with interpolation

Surface
  css_class generate only unique values? ex: <Button class="button">duplicates button</Button>
  don't generate properties when they are nil, empty? and false(y)?
  error when missing open " on property ex: <Icon size=small" />
  comments shortcut should insert <!-- --> or # should work
  <br /> generates <br>
  don't accept <br>, only <br />
  can we detect that the function was not defined for phx-click? function LearnSurfaceWeb.Playground.handle_event/3 is undefined or private
  <button click="click" doesn't complain that click doesn't exist
  LiveComponent needs root tag?


LiveView
  Should LiveView show errors in browser? ex: no function defined, errors on return values

  How to support native attributes?
  button should encapsulate icon?

  Icon page
    replace item with properties ex: style(fab), name(fa-erlang)
    create FaIcon where name can be just "erlang"
    is this too much complexity?
