Create new phoenix project
    mix phx.new hello

    when creating phoenix project do we need webpack or not(--no-webpack)
      we do because live view uses app.js to start infrastructure

    without database --no-ecto

lost on how to put the first page/component
missing information to install live_view from git

VSCode Elixir_LS mix.lock
  warning: found quoted keyword "surface" but the quotes are not required. Note that keywords are always atoms, even when quoted. Similar to atoms, keywords made exclusively of Unicode letters, numbers, underscore, and @ do not require quotes

get_flash
ctrl+click in properties
put components in *_web for reloading to work
ctrl+v with wrong identation
formatting

space on
      <button>
      {{ @inner_content.() }}
      </button>
  becomes
      <button>
      {{ @inner_content.() }}
      ////this empty line
      </button>

native attributes

css_class generate only unique values? ex: <Button class="button">duplicates button</Button>
button should encapsulate icon?
don't generate properties when they are nil, empty? and false(y)?

error when missing open " on property ex: <Icon size=small" />

Icon page
  replace item with properties ex: style(fab), name(fa-erlang)
  create FaIcon where name can be just "erlang"
  is this too much complexity?
