Create new phoenix project
    mix phx.new hello

    when creating phoenix project do we need webpack or not(--no-webpack)
      we do because live view uses app.js to start infrastructure

    without database --no-ecto

lost on how to put the first page/component
missing information to install live_view from git

VSCode Elixir_LS mix.lock
  warning: found quoted keyword "surface" but the quotes are not required. Note that keywords are always atoms, even when quoted. Similar to atoms, keywords made exclusively of Unicode letters, numbers, underscore, and @ do not require quotes
